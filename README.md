MistBot
===================


This is a very simple bot designed for use by a friend of mine - Twitch streamer themistmaster1 (https://twitch.tv/themistmaster1).

If anyone is so inclined they can use this code as the basis for their own bot but this is horribly underdeveloped as it's really meant to be used for this one channel only.  It's mostly here on Github for ease of storage.

How To Run
-------------
For Windows, follow these steps:
* Download Python 2.7.12 (this code has issues on newer versions right now, needs a fix...) https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/
* You'll want the "Windows x86-64 MSI installer" for 64 bit versions of Windows.
* Follow the instructions to install; it doesn't matter where you install Python.
* Download the Source code from here.
* Open up your Windows Start Menu and type "IDLE" and run the Python IDLE.
* Go to File -> Open and open up mistbot.py and config.py
* Update config.py to use the oauth token for the bot and save changes (CTRL + S).
* Go to mistboy.py and go to Run -> Run Module.
* The Bot will be running now and you can kill it by either closing the window it opens up or pressing CTRL + C.

For any Unix based OS, simply download the code, change the config.py to include the oauth token and run:
* $ python mistBoy.py
