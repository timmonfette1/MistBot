MistBot
===================


This is a very simple bot designed for use by a friend of mine - Twitch streamer themistmaster1 (https://twitch.tv/themistmaster1).

If anyone is so inclined they can use this code as the basis for their own bot but this is horribly underdeveloped as it's really meant to be used for this one channel only.  It's mostly here on Github for ease of storage.

My Twitch account can be found here for any curious https://twitch.tv/timmiluvs

How To Run
-------------
For Windows, download the latest Python release here https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/.
After that, download the code and run it. (insert more details)

For any Unix based OS, simply download the code and run `$ python mistBoy.py`

Make sure that in either case you edit the "config.py" file to included the oauth token for the bot's Twitch channel as well as the channel you wish to have the bot join.
